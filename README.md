# vac_covid19_sc_Combinations-of-Concern

This project was created as a task for Module 3 (out 5) of the Alura Bootcamp Data Sciences Applicada.

It is a continuation and extension of the exploratory work I already done for the first two modules of this bootcamp, when I reviewed the OpenDataSus registers of covid19 vaccination in the Brazilian State of Santa Catarina(SC) up to 30 May 20021.

The main finding from this initial work done using a mix of terminal command line, Python&Cloab and Excel was that:

for ~ 12% of registers (out of ~ 2 Million end of May 2021), we can not confirm which vaccine an individual received when I cross-checked 3 variables from the master dataset. I named this troublesome combinations as 'Combinations of Concern' - CoC (step 5 here after for definition).

This ~ 12% proportion of CoC's registrations was already noticed back in March and April, when the nr of registers were less than 1 Million and so I could use only Excel.

DES-EXCELANDO!!!!

My objectives for this Module 3 project were:

to use only Google Colab notebook and Python related packages, to check the OpenDataSus registration data up to 30 June 2021, and;

verify if the 12 % trend of 'Combinations of Concern' is still a matter for concern end June 2021.

This project is a work in progress and is being conceived and designed with the end-user in mind: the SC DIVE's UDVE managers and local vaccination teams accross the state of Santa Catarina.

My goal is that local UDVE teams may use the delivers of the final bootcamp project to help correct, clean and update their covid 19 registration files.

I am also aiming a high level of automation of the entire monitoring process, so the end-users can, at any time, quickly and easily track progress of the corrective actions to address the 'Combinations of Concern' - CoC.
